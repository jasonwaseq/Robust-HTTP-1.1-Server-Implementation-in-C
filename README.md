# Robust-HTTP-1.1-Server-Implementation-in-C

## Description:
This assignment involved designing and implementing a resilient HTTP/1.1 server in C, emphasizing a modular client–server architecture and low-level socket programming to handle incoming connections and requests without crashing under malformed or malicious input 
. It required parsing and constructing HTTP GET and PUT messages, managing file I/O to serve and update resources, and enforcing strict memory (≤10 MB) and performance constraints, while reinforcing abstractions through powerful helper libraries, string parsing with regex, and manual memory management 
.
